## 10/29/2025 9:33 PM - Just Making PCB and looking for components  

The project itself is very easy and doesn't require a case. The PCB didn't take long, but the programming took longer. I enjoyed working on this project.
A big problem for me was assigning footprints, which I had never done without internet knowledge, I wanted to understand it myself

## 10/29/2025 9:54 PM - Programming Filmware  

I love programming, so it didn't take me long. The problems were minor and I easily solved them. I expanded my knowledge, trained my fingers, and practiced my English by reading the documentation.

## 10/29/2025 9:58 PM - Bug fixes  

I tried simulating my project in a simulation program and found a few bugs that I quickly fixed. This wasn't too difficult either. Next time, I'll have to be more careful with pinout and code details.

Below is a screenshot from the beginning of work, when I didn't know how many stupid mistakes I made lol
